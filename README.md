# TheFirstExhaustiveAnalysisOfEpistemology

Context: I challenge myself to committing long-term continuous work (arguably the most important life skill) at studying exhaustively the topic of Epistemology.

My criterion for exhaustiveness is: reading and summarizing the gist of ALL the articles from [the Epistemology Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_epistemology_articles)

The choosen coverage order is alphabetical instead of hierachical.

Shall we begin:

[A Defence of Common Sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Defence_of_Common_Sense):
This analytical essay summary has no value beyond truisms 0/20
  * The essay refer to a ["famous" argument of the author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_is_one_hand):
    * invalid proof, does not imply any definite answer about the intricate nature of Reality. His truism about the common sense      interpretation having much higher verisimilitude than other hypothesises (matrix, dream, philosophical zombies) is.. a truism. -5/20 Explaining why some metaphysical hypothesises about the nature of reality are epistemologically stronger than others would have been worthwhile though.
    * todo recurse
