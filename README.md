# TheFirstExhaustiveAnalysisOfEpistemology

Context: I challenge myself to committing long-term continuous work (arguably the most important life skill) at studying exhaustively the topic of Epistemology.

My criterion for exhaustiveness is: reading and summarizing the gist of ALL the articles from [the Epistemology Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_epistemology_articles)

The choosen coverage order is alphabetical instead of hierachical.

Shall we begin:

[A Defence of Common Sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Defence_of_Common_Sense):
This analytical essay summary has no value beyond truisms 0/20
  * The essay refer to a ["famous" argument of the author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_is_one_hand):
    * invalid proof, does not imply any definite answer about the intricate nature of Reality. His truism about the common sense      interpretation having much higher verisimilitude than other hypothesises (matrix, dream, philosophical zombies) is.. a truism. -5/20   
    Explaining why some metaphysical hypothesises about the nature of reality are epistemologically stronger than others would have been worthwhile though.
    * todo recurse
 
[A posteriori/Empirical evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_evidence):
While understanding that all source of knowledge ( and associated meta-knowledge/verisimilitudes) eventually come down to experimental evidence, is mandatory (20/20) the article in itsefl has many simplifications and ommissions so here is a rephrasing/correction:
Empirical data comes either from sensorial data (~qualias from any living being) or from Instruments. This imply that advances in either psychometrics and *metrology* (and even data storage, validation, processing and retrieval) can enable leap in mankind progress.

 refer to:
  * reproducibility crisis
  * the scientific method
